        PUP College of Engineering and BFAR Regional Office No.1 have formed 
        a collaboration to enhance research and drive innovation in marine and 
        fisheries engineering. This collaboration combines the academic competence 
        of PUP College of Engineering with the practical understanding of BFAR Regional 
        Office No. 1 to address significant challenges in sustainable marine resource 
        management, aquaculture development, and coastal engineering. PUP College of Engineering 
        and BFAR Regional Office No.1 engage on knowledge-sharing efforts as a result of this 
        collaboration. PUP faculty and researchers engage with BFAR professionals to undertake 
        site visits, sampling, analysis, and project implementation. This partnership not only 
        improves the academic curriculum, but it also helps to move knowledge from research to 
        real-world applications.  Furthermore, the collaboration provides students with opportunity 
        to get practical experience through fieldwork. PUP students have the opportunity to apply 
        their academic knowledge in real-world circumstances and contribute to the sustainable 
        development of our maritime ecosystems by working closely with BFAR personnel. 
        The collaboration between PUP College of Engineering and BFAR Regional Office No.1 
        provides a useful platform for developing marine and fisheries engineering, encouraging 
        environmental stewardship, and assisting coastal regions' economic growth. This work 
        shows the value of academia-industry collaboration in addressing challenging challenges
         and influencing positive change in our maritime environment.
